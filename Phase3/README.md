In this project we created a cruise management system to track information about Cruise companies, ships, captains, crew, technicians, repairs, customers, scheduling, reservations, and trips. We used postgreSQL and JDBC to create an sql server and connect a java program to it to run several functions on the database. We are able to add ships, captains, and cruises to the database. We can also book cruises given a customer and a cruise number, list available seats on a cruise, list repairs per ship, and passengers with a given status for a given cruise.
